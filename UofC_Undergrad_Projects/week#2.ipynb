    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Dealing with probabilty can be quite complicated for humans since the concept itself is not intuitively understandable (just a natural feature of being a human). That's why using computers is a great idea when it comes to statistically analyzing given sets of data. Quite often, certain data follows a statistical distribution which can be expressed as a mathematical expression (Bernoulli, Hypogeometrical, Gaussian, etc.) and thus many statistically-important variables can be derived from them (eg. standart deviation). This lab explores an interesting example of probabilistical distribution - \"The infinite monkey theorem\", which basically proclaims that every possible outcome of the experiment is possible, given that number of trials is infinite and the experiment can go on for an infinite amount of time. Tthe purpose will be to compare different probability distributions when applied to spamlet (\"Simplified Hamplet\"), and to calculate entropy associated with those distributions."

    "## Discussion and conclusion:\n",
    "Probabilities are not intuitively understandable for humans and sometimes too rigorous thinking about and attempts to visualize them can lead to even greater confusion instead of clarification. I should admit that I had diffuclties with this assignment, not with the coding part, but with the question of understanding the way probabilities of independent events interact with each other. It was quite interesting to explore limitations of float type of data in Python, what is quite relevant since probabilites of highly unlikely events tend to decrease extremely fast. I am gratefull to authors of \"mpfmath\" package for bringing those tools to Python community as well. Finally, I think it's a great thought experiment to consider than any possible outcome is likely to occur given that number of trials and the timespan are infinite (\"Infinite Monkey Theorem\"). Also, I think it's crucial to develop a comprehensive understanding of entropy for any scientist since it looks like one of the most fundamental laws according to which nature exists. I will appreciate if you could give me feedback on points where I made mistakes."
